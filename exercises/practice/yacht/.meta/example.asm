    ; This function is basically a dispatch table for many different procedures.
    ; In other languages, the fun resides in finding higher-order patterns to reduce code size.
    ; I initially thought of trying creating many small procedures to pass around as callbacks.
    ; However, things seemed too convoluted and there was too much boilerplate involved.
    ; So, in the end, I just grouped what seemed natural to group, the numbers and the straights,
    ; the other categories were treated individually.
    ; I tried to minimize branching by using SETcc and CMOVcc when it seemed approppriate.
