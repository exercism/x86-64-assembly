# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what is a struct in C.
- Know about alignment in a C struct.
- Know how structs are passed to, and returned from, functions.

## Out of Scope

- Unions and other C types.

## Concepts

- `interfacing-with-c-structs`

## Prerequisites

- `interfacing-with-c-types`
- `bit-manipulation`
- `floating-point-numbers`
- `stack`

## Notes

The exercise is inspired by the [Go version of Need For Speed][go-need-for-speed], which is forked from C#.
However, it was heavily modified to focus on interfacing with C structs in x86-64 assembly code.
