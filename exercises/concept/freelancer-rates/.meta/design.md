# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what is a floating-point number.
- Know about single-precision and double-precision formats for floating-point numbers.
- Know how to do common arithmetic instructions using floating-point numbers.
- Know how to do other common operations with floating-point numbers.
- Know how to convert and round floating-point numbers to integers, and vice-versa.
- Know the calling convention in System V ABI for passing and returning floating-point values.
- Know how to declare floating-point values in memory.

## Out of Scope

- SIMD instructions.
- Different precisions for floating-point numbers, other than single (32-bit) and double (64-bit).

## Concepts

- `floating-point-numbers`

## Prerequisites

- `conditionals`
- `integers`
- `memory`

## Notes

The exercise is inspired by the [C++ version of Freelancer Rates][cpp-freelancer-rates], which is a fork of the Elixir version, which in turn is a fork of the original Javascript version.
