# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to work on individual bits.
- Know how to perform bitwise operations.
- Know about other useful instructions to manipulate bits.

## Out of Scope

- SIMD instructions

## Concepts

- `arrays`

## Prerequisites

- `integers`
- `conditionals`

## Notes

The exercise is inspired by the [Java version of Secrets][java-secrets], which is forked from crystal, which is in turn forked from elixir.
However, the exercise was heavily modified to include tasks for not only bitwise operations, but also for:

- rotations.
- population count.
- shifts to the left, as well as to the right.
