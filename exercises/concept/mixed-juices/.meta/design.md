## Notes

The exercise is inspired by the [JavaScript version of the exercise][javascript-mixed-juices], which is forked from [Swift's Expert Mixologist][swift-mixed-juices].
The first task, however, is borrowed from the original version.

There were some changes to the exercise so as to avoid parsing strings.
