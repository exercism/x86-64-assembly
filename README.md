Exercism exercises in x86-64 Assembly.

## NASM

NASM (The Netwide Assembler) is the assembler used by this track. It's a
popular assembler with a syntax that is simple and easy to understand.

## Unity

Unity is a simple unit testing framework for C used by this track. Using a
framework written in C instead of assembly language is easier to understand. It
also shows how parameters are passed when calling assembly routines from C.

## Calling conventions

There are two calling conventions in common use for x86-64. The Microsoft x64
calling convention, and the System V AMD64 ABI. Support is only provided for
the latter. This will spare mentors the trouble of having to switch between the
two.

## Generating test cases

To create a test generator, add a .py file to the generators/exercises folder
with the name of the exercise. See [leap.py](https://github.com/exercism/x86-64-assembly/blob/master/generators/exercises/leap.py) for an example.

Generate the test cases with the following command:

```bash
./generators/generate <exercise name>
```
